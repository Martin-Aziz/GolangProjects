### NASA Collage

One of the most popular websites at NASA is the [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html). They have an [archive of all photos](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/archivepix.html) by day.

Using this archive and Go build the smallest possible rectangular collage. Or return an error if there is no possible combination between all dates.

Rules:

- You should use original photos, cutting is not allowed, but you can resize them proportionally.
- One photo can't be used more than once on the collage.
- It should be more than 10 photos on the collage.

Submit PR with code and photo file `collage.png`.
