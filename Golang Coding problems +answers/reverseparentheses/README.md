### Reverse Parentheses

Complete the function that reverses characters in (possibly nested) parentheses in the input string. Input strings will always be well-formed with matching ()s.

### Examples

```
(bar)             => rab
foo(bar)baz       => foorabbaz
foo(bar(baz))blim => foobazrabblim
```

### Run tests with benchmarks

```
go test -bench .
```
