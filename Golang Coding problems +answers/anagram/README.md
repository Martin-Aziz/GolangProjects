### Anagrams

When two or more words are composed of the same characters, but in a different order, they are called [anagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram). Write a function `FindAnagrams(dictionary []string, word string) []string` that will find all possible anagrams for the given string in a given dictionary.

Sample anagram:
```
"Madam Curie" = "Radium came"
```
