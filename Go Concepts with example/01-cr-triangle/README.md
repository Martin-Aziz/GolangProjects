#### Steps

 - `go get github.com/esimov/triangle/cmd/triangle`
 - `cd github.com/esimov/triangle`
 - Create a new branch `codereview`
 - `gofmt` all files
 - We will focus on `cmd` Go code, not all package as it's big and has a lot of image processing, which I personally don't enjojy.
 - As of Go 1.5, the default value of GOMAXPROCS is the number of CPUs, so we can remove init() func. Verify using Printf.
 - Let's test with `gopher/jpg`: `go run cmd/triangle/main.go --in ~/go/src/github.com/plutov/packagemain/02-cr-triangle/gopher.jpg --out gopher.jpg`
- Fix `Saved as`: `output.Name()`
 - Test --in file and --out as dir, invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference. Replace to `file.Name()`
 - Test `go run cmd/triangle/main.go --in ~/go/src/github.com/plutov/packagemain/02-cr-triangle --out gopher`. Rename `dir` to `dir := strings.TrimRight(*source, "/")`
- Add more description to Fatal(). Use `Fatalf`.
 - Remove `ch` as it's not necessary.
 - Remove `item` type as not used.
 - Combine `process` using `toProcess` map.
 - Do we really need wait group as inside process we have a lock? let's remove it.
 - Move `process` to a `triangle` package. Create type `Processor` with options from flags. Move `spinner` func also.
 - Let's remove all fmt.Print from process.go and move it to cmd. In this case people can use this function without being annoyed by unexpected debug.
 - Calculate time in cmd file.
 - Process will return `triangles` and `points`. Make triangles and points local func vars.
 - in process.go change loop to `for _, t := range triangles {`.
